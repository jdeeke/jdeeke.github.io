# Julie Deeke

I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the Statistics Department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

As an educator, I want my students to have authentic experiences working with and analyzing data, building skills and tools in the process that can be applied to new problems.

I specialize in teaching large, applied courses, including Data Science Exploration (Stat 207, a second course in data science) and Methods of Applied Statistics (Stat 420/ASRM 450, an upper-level applied regression course).  My scholarly interests include statistics and data science education, graduate student teaching development, instructional technology, and pedagogy for large courses.
